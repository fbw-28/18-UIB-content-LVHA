    <h2>GroundHogs</h2>

    <p>This morning (Feb. 2), a groundhog will not predict the weather.</p>

    <p>Groundhogs
      <a href="#">(Marmota monax)</a> are vegetarian, dirt-dwelling North American rodents the size of small dogs. In parts of the United
      States, tradition dictates that a particular groundhog has the power to predict the length of winter weather. If this
      year's
      <a href="#">Punxsutawney Phil</a> (a name given to a groundhog in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania) sees his shadow, the idea goes, there
      will be six more weeks of winter weather. If he doesn't see his shadow, spring will come early. Of course, neither
      Phil nor any other groundhog has weather-predicting powers. It's a fun thought though, isn't it?</p>

    <h2>What now?</h2>

    <p>What will groundhogs not kept in captivity for the sake of odd secular holidays do if winter conditions persist into
      March? [

    <p>The answer, it turns out, is pretty simple: Keep sleeping.</p>
